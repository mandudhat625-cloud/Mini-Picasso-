Mini Picasso 🎨🛠️

A Desktop CNC Drawing & Paper-Cutting Machine

Overview

Mini Picasso is my first major hands-on technical project. It is a compact desktop CNC machine designed to draw accurate diagrams, patterns, and perform light paper cutting. The goal of this project is to understand how CNC machines work by building one from scratch using basic mechanical, electronic, and software components.

This machine will also be used as a tool for future projects, allowing me to create precise drawings, templates, and small parts instead of relying on manual methods.

What Mini Picasso Can Do

Draw precise diagrams and patterns

Convert digital designs (G-code) into physical motion

Lift and lower a pen or tool using a servo mechanism

Perform light cutting on paper or thin materials



---

How It Works (High Level)

NEMA 17 stepper motors control the X and Y axes

Threaded rods convert motor rotation into linear motion

Arduino UNO + CNC Shield (GRBL) interprets G-code

Servo motor controls pen/tool up–down movement

12V power supply provides stable power to the system



---

Current Project Status

Component selection finalized

CNC electronics and controller planned

Learning GRBL firmware and CNC motion basics

Mechanical layout and axis design in progress


(This repository will be updated as the build progresses.)


---

What I Will Do After Funding

Assemble the CNC electronics and motors

Build the mechanical frame and axis system

Test motor movement and accuracy

Upload photos, videos, wiring diagrams, and code

Share learnings and improvements openly

Learning Goals

Through this project, I aim to learn:

Stepper motor control and motion systems

CNC firmware (GRBL) and G-code

Mechanical design using lead screws and frames

Hardware–software integration

Precision manufacturing concepts

Why This Project Matters

Mini Picasso is not a one-time build. It is a long-term learning tool that will support many future hardware projects by enabling accurate, repeatable, and precise fabrication.
