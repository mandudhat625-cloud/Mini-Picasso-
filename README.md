# Mini-Picasso-
Mini Picasso is my first major technical project. It is a compact, multipurpose machine designed to create accurate diagrams and work as a small paper-cutting tool. This project improves precision, saves time, and turns ideas into physical results while giving me hands-on experience in mechanical design, basic electronics, and problem-solving.
